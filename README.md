**Project Name:** Bank Loan Classification

üè¶ This exciting data science project focuses on predicting loan approvals for a bank. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we've developed a classification model that assesses loan applications, helping the bank make informed decisions.

**Key Highlights:**
- Utilized machine learning algorithms to evaluate loan applications.
- Addressed class imbalance using resampling techniques to improve model accuracy.
- Streamlined the decision-making process for loan approvals, benefiting both the bank and applicants.

Feel free to explore the project to dive deeper into the details and discover the power of data science in the world of banking! üöÄ
